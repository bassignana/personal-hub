# Development Notes
Gitignoring venv for now, so we recreate the env every time docker runs.

# Usage
run `docker-compose up --build`

# Todo
- don't do blogs, do ideas. 
- also do tech stacks, not skills.
- also implement generators.
- 'Ideas in software'
    - put both here, maybe in different formats. More complex ideas in separate app/website   
        - better name for blog (not ideas)
        - better name for skills (patterns, tech patterns)
